## Project idea 
  
App allowing the user to detect four types of road signs on a photo provided by the user: identification, directional, informational, and regulatory. Created for a university course called "Image Analysis". The app was written 100% in Matlab. The project documentation was written in Polish due to the course restrictions.
  
## Skills gained during project
  
  -> Knowledge of image preprocessing such as:  
        Binarization  
        Image filters (Gaussian etc.)  
        Noise reduction  
        Operations such as closing, opening etc.  
  -> Usage of neural networks (feedforwardnet)  
  -> What are geometry coefficients  
  -> Creating an algorithm to single out road signs using image preprocessing and geometry coefficients  
  -> Creating a proper markdown file
